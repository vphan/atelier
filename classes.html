		<h3>Admissions Procedures</h3>
		<p>The ASCR has an open enrollment policy. Because we work closely with each student on an individual basis, it is important to meet in person before study begins. For the prospective student with an art background, a member of the ASCR faculty will review a portfolio of his or her drawings and paintings, originals when possible and if necessary, digital images or slides. Beginning students without portfolios have the opportunity to see the school and observe classes in session. Working with the new ASCR student in this way, we can help them assess their needs and develop a program tailored to their artistic goals.</p>
	
	
	

		<h3>The Old Master Drawing & Painting Technical Foundation Class</h3>

<br>Afternoon Classes meets <b>1:00 PM to 4:00 PM</b> and Evening Classes meets <b>6:30 PM to 9:30 PM</b>. </p>

<p>This is an ongoing course and begins with drawing exercises to develop the understanding and skills necessary to use value (tone) for realistic rendering. Visual memory comparison measurements are used. </p>

<p>Students explore Old Master techniques for creating depth, distance, atmosphere, solid form, and convincing surface textures on a two-dimensional surface. Subjects range through cast studies, self portraits and still lifes.</p>
<p>Painting is begun once students have mastered the drawing segment of the course or its equivalent (subject to approval). The study of COLOR TEMPERATURE at the ASCR is one of the most thorough and helpful being taught today.  The dynamics of color as affected by pictorial lighting come alive for the student artist.  Advanced students learn the direct approaches to PLEIN AIR oil painting followed by coaching in Old Master layered glazing techniques.</p>

<ul><li>Drawing in tonal values</li>
<li>Drawing from Casts</li>
<li>Oil Staining</li>
