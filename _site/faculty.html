<h3>David Hardy</h3>
<h4>Founder and Director of ASCR
<br>OLD MASTER DRAWING & PAINTING TECHNICAL FOUNDATION INSTRUCTOR </h4>
<p>If you have specialized knowledge" says David Hardy, "I believe you have a responsibility to share what you know with others; in other words, to teach." Founder and Director of the Atelier School of Classical Realism, he brings to his many years of teaching an impressive knowledge of Baroque art and traditional approaches to drawing and painting. He studied at the American Academy in Chicago, the New York School of Visual Arts and the Art Students League of New York. His artwork is featured in various text and specialty books including <b><i>A Guide to Drawing</i></b>, Fifth Edition, by Daniel M. Mendelowitz and Duane A. Wakeham. Hardy and the Atelier are also discussed in <b><i>The Undressed Art: Why We Draw</i></b> by Peter Steinhart, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 2004. He has participated in docent training for the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, appeared as guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and taught for a number of years at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland.</p>

<h3>Diana Boegel</h3>
<h4>CERTIFICATE DAY PROGRAM TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR DAVID HARDY </h4>
<p>After extensive art studies at California College of Arts and Crafts, Diana Boegel in 1992 met and started studying with realist painter Alan McCorkle in his Lafayette, California studio. Shortly before McCorkle's untimely death, Diana introduced herself to David Hardy, founder of the Atelier School of Classical Realism in Oakland. They forged a good student-teacher relationship while exploring the marvels of Old Master technology over many years. As of September 2011, she joins the faculty of the Atelier School of Classical Realism. Diana's focus has always been on representational art, or as she says, "it has always been in my heart and soul." Today Diana Boegel uses an extensive set of skills and knowledge to paint or draw what really matters to her. Her artwork is collected nationally and abroad.</p>
