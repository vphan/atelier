		<h2>The Old Master Drawing & Painting Technical Foundation Class</h2>
		<p>$350.00/monthly
		<br>Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM
		<br>Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM </p>

<p>This is an ongoing course and begins with drawing exercises to develop the understanding and skills necessary to use value (tone) for realistic rendering. Visual memory comparison measurements are used. </p>

<p>Students explore Old Master techniques for creating depth, distance, atmosphere, solid form, and convincing surface textures on a two-dimensional surface. Subjects range through cast studies, self portraits and still lifes.</p>
<p>Painting is begun once students have mastered the drawing segment of the course or its equivalent (subject to approval). The study of COLOR TEMPERATURE at the ASCR is one of the most thorough and helpful being taught today.  The dynamics of color as affected by pictorial lighting come alive for the student artist.  Advanced students learn the direct approaches to PLEIN AIR oil painting followed by coaching in Old Master layered glazing techniques.</p>

		<h2>Figure Drawing & Anatomy Class</h2>
		<p>The anatomy class is divided into 3 trimesters 
		<br>$600/ Fall Trimester: October 6 - December 15 
		<br>$600/ Winter Trimester: January 12 - March 23
		<br>$400/ Spring Trimester: April 13 - May 25
		
		<p>$130.00 per session/Drop in, pay as you go</p>
		<p>This Class meets every other Saturday, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM
		<p><b>Spring Trimester Anatomy Schedule:</b>


		<br>Apr 13: Head â€“ Planes, Neck
<br>Apr 27: Head Features
<br>May 11: Heads and Hands
<br>May 25: The Clothed Figure</p>



	<p>The purpose of class is to provide each student an introduction of knowledge on anatomy for artists. At the same time, students will gain drawing experiences and basic skills in terms of drawing from the human figure. </p>

<p>The objective is for you to understand and analyze the structure underneath the human body in a conceptual manner. Students will be able to draw the human figure more accurately displaying proportional relationships. During the beginning of each class, we will do a series of gesture drawings in a brief period of time. Homework will be assigned at the end of the class each week to reinforce the knowledge and draftsmanship of students. </p>

<p>The course format consists of short lectures and demonstrations, with most of the time dedicated to hands-on practice with input from the instructor. Each class concludes with a critique and discussion of the day's work in a supportive spirit of learning how to paint effective images.</p>

		<h2>Sunday Long Pose Figure Drawing Workshop</h2>
<p>$15.00 per session if paid in advance monthly
<br>$20.00 per session "drop in" 
<br>Sunday 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM
</p>
<p>This is a time for independent study and development of individual initiative. The model takes one pose for the session. These are repeated for about two months and, when desired by a majority of those participating, even longer. This permits students to study the anatomy of the model in detail. A marvelous opportunity is also presented to gain experience in the final finishing of a figure drawing or figure painting. There is no instruction during the workshops, but critiques are available during regular class hours. </p>

<h4>Admissions Procedure for The Old Master Drawing & Painting Technical Foundation Class</h4>
		<p>The ASCR has an open enrollment policy. Because we work closely with each student on an individual basis, it is important to meet in person before study begins. For the prospective student with an art background, a member of the ASCR faculty will review a portfolio of his or her drawings and paintings, originals when possible and if necessary, digital images or slides. Beginning students without portfolios have the opportunity to see the school and observe classes in session. Working with the new ASCR student in this way, we can help them assess their needs and develop a program tailored to their artistic goals.</p>

<h4>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICIES</h4>

<p>Should a student decide to withdraw before entering into instruction, the Atelier School of Classical Realism must be notified in writing seven (7) days of the date of the agreement, where upon all agreements made in advance will be refunded.</p>

<p>Should a student withdraw prior to the elapse of the seven (7) day period and before entering into instruction, 90% of the total cost of tuition will be refunded. </p>

<p>Should the student withdraw or be dismissed after instruction has begun, but before completion of the session, 85% of the tuition will be refunded if termination occurs during first week of instruction. </p>

<p>Should the student withdraw or be dismissed after instruction has begun, but later than one week and less than completion of a fourth week, 50% of the tuition will be refunded.</p> 

<p>After the first four (4) weeks of instruction, no refunds will be made. All refunds will be sent within thirty (30) days of withdrawal.</p>
