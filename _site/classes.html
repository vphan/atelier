		<h3>Admissions Procedures</h3>
		<p>The ASCR has an open enrollment policy. Because we work closely with each student on an individual basis, it is important to meet in person before study begins. For the prospective student with an art background, a member of the ASCR faculty will review a portfolio of his or her drawings and paintings, originals when possible and if necessary, digital images or slides. Beginning students without portfolios have the opportunity to see the school and observe classes in session. Working with the new ASCR student in this way, we can help them assess their needs and develop a program tailored to their artistic goals.</p>
