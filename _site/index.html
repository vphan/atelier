<h2>The Atelier School of Classical Realism</h2>

<p>The Atelier School of Classical Realism (ASCR) stands out as a unique educational experience. Located in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area, the ASCR focuses on the marvelous range of technical artistic knowledge, understanding and observation of nature that helped make the impressive accomplishments of the masters of realism possible.</p>

<p>The mission of the ASCR is to help the artists of today learn those techniques and apply them to their art.  Our goal is to provide the best formal training in realism available tailored to the individual needs of each student.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the school begins in the belief that realism in art is only as effective as it is convincing. The curriculum at the ASCR explores the dynamics of realistic representation.  The core of the program is training in the techniques used to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. </p>

<p>The ASCR approaches the teaching of art as introducing students to the challenge of learning a new language, a visual language.  They learn the structure that is required to genuinely and comfortably "speak" this visual language and gain the technical knowledge which serves as its grammar and vocabulary.  The founder of the school, David Hardy, feels strongly that students must build a solid technical foundation from which to work.  "You can always leave out some of what you know," says Hardy, "but you can’t put in what you don’t know."</p>

<p>Giving students a clear understanding of the logic behind the techniques and methods of realism is also an essential component of the ASCR instruction. "Understanding the logic allows the artist to use those techniques and methods in a way that is completely true to their self," says Hardy.  "One then becomes master of one’s art instead of a slave to the happy accident."  That logical understanding coupled with technical mastery opens students at the ASCR to new possibilities in freedom of expression.   Through learning creative control, they are freed as artists to be more effectively themselves, and thus share genuine beliefs and emotional responses through their art.</p>

<p>Students find the rigorous, traditional approach offered at the ASCR a bridge to now little-known techniques and principles inherited from the golden days of realism.  Once learned these methods will help them to effectively establish a beachhead in today’s challenging art world.  Highly personalized attention is directed toward students to encourage individual growth.  Advanced students are encouraged to fine-tune drawing and painting skills to maximize accomplishment.  Emerging and established art professionals alike are given career counseling.</p>

<p>The development of self awareness and self confidence go hand in hand with the study of drawing and painting at the Atelier School of Classical Realism.   Success demands that one take the necessary time and effort to learn about oneself, and in so doing, develop the wisdom and patience to choose carefully as one proceeds. Hardy is emphatic when he maintains that "technique without personal conviction and emotional involvement robs art of its soul, its very reason for being.  Memorable and enduring art is a dialogue between the artist and the Great Out There.  It is a sharing.  It is communication."</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL</h4>

<p>New students attending the ASCR will quickly become aware of two major features of the school:</p>

<p>The first is the feeling shared by the students of being at ease with each other, friends among friends. It is a collegial environment of mutual understanding and earned respect.  Lunchtime blossoms into "catching up", comparing ideas and opinions, enjoying the weather, joking and having fun. </p>

<p>The second is the level of dedication at the ASCR to the study of the art and techniques of realism.  The ASCR offers a positive environment of helpful criticism, encouragement and personal involvement. It shows in the deep personal commitment by the students to the pursuit of their studies.   And it is evident in the professional commitment of the faculty to help the students meet their artistic goals.</p>

<h4>LOCATION</h4>

<p>The Atelier School of Classical Realism is in the Temescal area of Oakland, California. It is a twenty minute drive from San Francisco and ten minutes from the University of California, Berkeley.  Both bus and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services are conveniently near.   The ASCR is surrounded by various popular eating places favored by the students.  The ethnic diversity of cuisines is an indicator of the remarkable range of cultures and traditions to be found surrounding San Francisco Bay.</p>
