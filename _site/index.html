<h2>The Atelier School of Classical Realism</h2>

<p>Realism in art is only as effective as it is convincing.   Atelier students are challenged with learning a new language, a visual language. They learn to genuinely and comfortably "speak" this visual language, using technical knowledge to serve as its grammar and vocabulary.</p> 

<p>Founder of the school, award winning David Hardy, feels strongly that students must build a solid technical foundation from which to work. In other words, become master of one's art rather than of a slave to the happy accident.
Students find the rigorous, traditional approach offered at the Atelier a bridge to now little-known techniques and principles inherited from the golden days of realism.  Once learned, these methods help to effectively establish a beachhead in today's challenging art world.</p>

<p>Highly personalized guidance, made possible with small classes, encourages individual growth.  Advanced students learn to fine-tune drawing and painting skills, thus maximizing accomplishment.  Advanced students, including both emerging and established art professionals, are offered career counseling and business procedures. Museum field trips are correlated with Atelier studies.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL</h4>

<p>New students attending the ASCR will quickly become aware of two major features of the school:</p>

<p>The first is the feeling shared by the students of being at ease with each other, friends among friends. It is a collegial environment of mutual understanding and earned respect.  Lunchtime blossoms into "catching up", comparing ideas and opinions, enjoying the weather, joking and having fun. </p>

<p>The second is the level of dedication at the ASCR to the study of the art and techniques of realism.  The ASCR offers a positive environment of helpful criticism, encouragement and personal involvement. It shows in the deep personal commitment by the students to the pursuit of their studies.   And it is evident in the professional commitment of the faculty to help the students meet their artistic goals.</p>

<h4>LOCATION</h4>

<p>The Atelier School of Classical Realism is in the Temescal area of Oakland, California. It is a twenty minute drive from San Francisco and ten minutes from the University of California, Berkeley.  Both bus and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services are conveniently near.   The ASCR is surrounded by various popular eating places favored by the students.  The ethnic diversity of cuisines is an indicator of the remarkable range of cultures and traditions to be found surrounding San Francisco Bay.</p>
